\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introductory remarks
\end{itemize}

\section{Background}
\begin{itemize}
% perhaps a discussion of lightning behavior first,
% then segue into modeling
% ... then into the following?
% (your audience would probably appreciate it, and it would be good to present)
\item Ohm's law
\item Charge conservation
\item EFIE
\item Thin wire approximation
\item Basically the same as section 2 in \cite{mathdev}
\end{itemize}

\section{Framework}
\begin{itemize}
\item Channel geometry (with pictures!)
\item Overview of model operation and organization of history vector
\end{itemize}

\section{Generating the Matrix}
\begin{itemize}
\item Computation of geometric factors
\item Interpolation of charges and currents
\item Putting everything together to get the transition matrix
\end{itemize}

\section{Two-Stage Stepping}
\begin{itemize}
\item Motivation for two-stage averaging scheme
\item Details of implementation
\end{itemize}

\section{Stability Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item Overview of eigenvalue-based stability analysis
\item Pretty plots of eigenvalues! (and comments thereupon)
% be sure to include a discussion of the main slowly-decaying slowly-oscillating eigenvectors (standing wave modes, basically)
\item Effect of parameters on stability
\end{itemize}

\section{Equilibrium Charge Distribution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Plots of equilibrium charge distribution with and without external field
\item Comparison to results in Jackson paper
\end{itemize}

\section{Off-Channel Field}
\begin{itemize}
\item Details of off-channel field calculation
\item Effect of distance and orientation on measured field
\end{itemize}

\section{Stepped Leaders}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementation of adding segments
\item Plots of off-channel field, comparison to HAMMA data
\end{itemize}

\section{Frequency Response of Channel to External Field}
\begin{itemize}
\item Power spectral density of radiated field
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendices}
\begin{itemize}
\item Briefly describe functions in microTDFL.py and their inputs/outputs
% include some sample code as a demo?  (there are various packages to render code in LaTeX...  i like minted, if you can get it to work, but "listings" is pretty good too)
\end{itemize}

\bibliography{microTDFL.bbl}
% ahh, bibtex...  let me know if you want some additional references.
